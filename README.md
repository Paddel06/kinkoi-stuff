# kinkoi_stuff
Just some scripts I wrote to make modding KinKoi (and other Saga Planets x Entergram games like Karumaruka Circle) on Vita a bit easier.  
Very WIP, but does what it should

- kinkoi.arc.bms is for extracting the ARCs found in the game files using quickbms  
- pack_arc.py can repack those arcs and generate the info.bin for the script.arc
